            <p>
              For food enthusiasts, sometimes we like to go back to excellent
              addresses that we have tried before : you don't change a winning
              team ! We don't want a new restaurant address, we want one we
              already know and loved! But it was so long ago...we don't remember
              the name of the restaurant...and this one, we already went there,
              but we don't know if the food was good, how can we remember? For
              example, when someone comes to visit us and we would like to take
              him/her to that great restaurant we went to a long time
              ago...what's its name again? Or our friend would prefer Japanese
              food, where can I take him to eat something of sure value? No
              question of taking risks. Sometimes we don't want to rely on the
              opinions of restaurant websites, we prefer to rely on our own
              experiences: we trust our tastes! How can we remember those good
              restaurants we went to in the past, and how can we not go back to
              those we didn't like if we don't remember?
            </p>

            <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>
              Why not create your own restaurant guide? We can only trust the
              address when it comes to our own opinions! There are so many
              cities where we have been, and so many restaurants that we don't
              remember the name or address when we went to Italy, or when we
              went to Paris, or even restaurants in our own city where we forget
              to go when we look for somewhere to eat. With a database system,
              it would be possible to keep personal notes, on our opinion about
              a restaurant where we have just eaten.
              <br />
              We could then easily access this information on a website, from
              any device. It would be interesting to classify the restaurants
              among those we liked and hated, or by specialty: an Italian,
              Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, ... restaurant. All that will
              be left to do is to create a "search" section in the site, where
              you can find certain restaurants in the database according to
              their location or the type of cuisine for example.

            <h3>HOW TO CODE</h3>
            <p>
              In the following lines we will explain the required steps to code
              this project:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First you need to create a database where to store and retrieve
                your data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then you need to create a form to enter the data into the
                database.
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally you need to save the data from the form into the
                database.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <br />
              <b>First create a database</b><br />
              <u>What is a database ? </u><br />
              A database, allows the storage and retrieval of raw data or
              information, often related to a theme or activity; these can be of
              different natures and more or less related to each other.

              For this project we decided to create a Firebase database, as a
              free plan is available and it has good API to interact with the
              data. To create a Firebase database, you first need to create an
              account on
              <a target="_blank" href="https://console.firebase.google.com/"
                >Firebase</a
              >, in order to use it later to save and retrieve data from it.

              />
              <br /><br />
              <b>Now we create a form</b><br />
              For this project we created a form which you can access by
              clicking on the following link
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://assignment-databa-restaurant.glitch.me/demo.html"
                >Demo</a
              >
              (also in the navigation bar). This form allows you to enter the
              data of a new restaurant. The layout construction has been made
              simple by using the Skeleton framework, which in particular allows
              to obtain responsive pages.
              <br />
              Within this form each input field has its own id, which will allow
              us to esily get the data using jquery.<br /><br />

              <img
                alt="idcity"
                src="https://cdn.glitch.com/d2fd3450-7483-4273-861b-aae10322aed5%2Flabel%20city.JPG?v=1604256077667"
                class="picture"
              /><br />

              <br />
              <b>Finally save the data</b><br />
              A button at the bottom of the page launches a javascript function
              which will read data from the form<br /><br />

              <img
                alt="idcity"
                src="https://cdn.glitch.com/d2fd3450-7483-4273-861b-aae10322aed5%2Fvar%20save%20restaurant.JPG?v=1604256289894"
                class="picture"
              />
              <br /><br />

              connect to the database<br /><br />

              <img
                alt="idcity"
                src="https://cdn.glitch.com/d2fd3450-7483-4273-861b-aae10322aed5%2Ffirebase%20parameters.JPG?v=1604256401272"
                class="picture"
              />
              <br /><br />

              and save the data inside a new record.<br /><br />

              <img
                alt="idcity"
                src="https://cdn.glitch.com/d2fd3450-7483-4273-861b-aae10322aed5%2Fsave%20data.JPG?v=1604256443675"
                class="picture"
              />
              <br /><br />

              Once saved, this is how the data looks inside Firebase.
              <br /><br />

              <img
                alt="idcity"
                src="https://cdn.glitch.com/d2fd3450-7483-4273-861b-aae10322aed5%2Ffirebase%20final.JPG?v=1604256796673"
                class="picture"
              />
              <br /><br />

              <b>What's next</b><br />
              To go further, we could imagine retrieving the data by city, or
              grade and display the result.<br />
              We could also imagine storing the geographic location of each
              retaurant and disply it on a google map...
