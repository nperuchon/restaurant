            <p>
              For food enthusiasts, sometimes we like to go back to excellent
              addresses that we have tried before : you don't change a winning
              team ! We don't want a new restaurant address, we want one we
              already know and loved! But it was so long ago...we don't remember
              the name of the restaurant...and this one, we already went there,
              but we don't know if the food was good, how can we remember? For
              example, when someone comes to visit us and we would like to take
              him/her to that great restaurant we went to a long time
              ago...what's its name again? Or our friend would prefer Japanese
              food, where can I take him to eat something of sure value? No
              question of taking risks. Sometimes we don't want to rely on the
              opinions of restaurant websites, we prefer to rely on our own
              experiences: we trust our tastes! How can we remember those good
              restaurants we went to in the past, and how can we not go back to
              those we didn't like if we don't remember?

            <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>
              Why not create your own restoration guide? We can only trust the
              address when it comes to our own opinions! There are so many
              cities where we have gone, and so many restaurants that we don't
              remember the name and address when we went to Italy, or when we
              went to Paris, or even restaurants in our city where we forget to
              go when we look for somewhere to eat. With a database system, it
              would then be possible to note down our own personal notes, on our
              opinion about a restaurant where we have just eaten. We could then
              easily access this information on a website, from any device. It
              would be interesting to classify the restaurants among those we
              liked and hated, or by specialty: an Italian, Chinese, Japanese,
              French, Spanish, Breton, ... restaurant. All that will be left to
              do is to create a "search" section in the site, where you can find
              certain restaurants in the database according to their location or
              the type of cuisine for example.

            <h3>HOW TO CODE</h3>
            <p>
              To create this kind of form, you must first know the concept of a
              database. <br />
              <br />
              <b>What is a database ? </b><br />
              A database, allows the storage and retrieval of raw data or
              information, often related to a theme or activity; these can be of
              different natures and more or less related to each other.

            <p>
              To create a database, you need to create an account on
              <a target="_blank" href="https://console.firebase.google.com/"
                >Firebase</a
              >, in order to use it later to retrieve data.
